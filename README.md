# Fear and Loathing in Romanian: An experimental study on the sematic properties of psych-verbs

This project was conducted during my Master's degree in Linguistics at Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, inspired by the reasearch of [Prof. Elisabeth Verhoeven](https://www2.hu-berlin.de/experiencer/alternation/en/index.html) and [Hartshorne et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308761372_Psych_verbs_the_linking_problem_and_the_acquisition_of_language) on psych-verbs. 

**Psych-verbs** (also psychological verbs or experiencer verbs/predicates) express the mental state or emotion of an experiencer. The experiencer role refers to a participant that undergoes an event affecting consciousness. The experiencer can appear in one of two positions: as subject (**subject experiencer - SE**) or as object (**object experiencer - OE**). For example, in the sentences:

- *Jack scares Wendy.* - Wendy is the OE of an action (emotion) inflicted by Jack upon her.
- *Wendy fears Jack.* - Wendy is the SE of an emotion that arises within her in response to Jack being perceived as a threat. 

To explore psych verbs in Romanian, I compiled a list of verbs and asked native speakers to rate them on duration, valence, and arousal. The analysis of the results can be found in the [psych-verbs Jupyther Notebook](https://github.com/lorenanda/psych-verbs/blob/master/psych-verbs.ipynb) and includes:
- descriptive analysis (by experiencer, emotion domain, rating feature, and verb)
- clustering (K-Means)
- classification (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

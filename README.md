# Fear and Loathing in Romanian: An experimental study on the sematic properties of psych-verbs


## Description
This project was conducted during my Master's degree in Linguistics at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and was inspired by the reasearch of Prof. Elisabeth Verhoeven and Hawthorn on psych-verbs. 

Psychological verbs (also psych-verbs, experiencer verbs/predicates) describe the mental state or emotion of the participants (experiencers). A psych-verb is “any verb that carries psychological entailments with respect to one of its arguments (the Experiencer). A psychological entailment involves an individual being in a certain mental state” (Landau, 2010:54). “The experiencer role refers to a participant that undergoes an event affecting consciousness, i.e., an event of emotion, cognition, volition, perception, or bodily sensation” (Verhoeven, 2014). Thus, experiencer verbs license an experiencer/patiens which is animate and does not have control over the situation, and a stimulus argument/agens which is “the cause of an experiential situation or the target of a perceptual experience and can be either animate or inanimate” (Verhoeven, 2014:130). “Psych effects are “specific syntactic properties associated with experiencers” (Landau, 2010:6). “Psych predicates pose a challenge in linguistic analysis because they exhibit special properties that defy syntactic rules of argument structure. The analysis of psych predicates is important for the architecture of grammar, especially for the lexicon-syntax interface” (Rozwadowska:1).

## Experiment design
I have created a list of 54 Romanian verbs from six emotion categories. Some of these verbs are used as examples in the literature explaining the structure of psych-verbs. Each verb is to be rated on four criteria: valence (whether the verb expresses a negative or a positive emotion), arousal (how intense is the emotion expressed by the verb), duration (how long is the emotion expressed by the verb likely to last), and cause (whether the emotion expressed by the verb is likely to be caused by external or internal factors, in the sense of felt from within the experiencer). This questionnaire was given to 30 participants (Mage = years, SD = ), all native speakers of Romanian. The order of the verbs was randomized for each participant, so that the verb order could not influence the rating process. The participants were selected through word of mouth and snowball effect, and were not compensated for their participation in the study. They were given the questionnaire in paper-form or sent via email.

## Data analysis
I analyzed and visualized the resulting data in Python, using different libraries: 
- for descriptive data analysis: pandas
- for data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- for clustering and classification: scikit-learn
 
The complete data analysis can be found in the [psych-verbs Jupyther Notebook](https://github.com/lorenanda/psych-verbs/blob/master/psych-verbs.ipynb).

## Findings

## Outlook / Discussion
Thogh this experiment revealed some interesting findings, this subject can be explored further. The main limitation of this study is the small sample size of participants. Moreover, it would be interesting to explore whether there are difference by gender or age.
